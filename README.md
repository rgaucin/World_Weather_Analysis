# World Weather Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to create an interactive world map with which to plan travel itineraries. Via API calls to OpenWeather and Google Maps, weather conditions and hotels of hundreds of cities were collected and displayed. User input was taken to reduce the list of cities to preferred travel locations, then a travel itinerary looping through four nearby cities was created and displayed.
